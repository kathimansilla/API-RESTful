# API RESTful 
## 👩🏻‍💻 **Kathi Mansilla** @kathimansilla 

This is a RESTful API for getting, inserting, updating, and deleting data from a SQL database. Specifically, it has been designed to work with a recipes database, where each entry includes an ID and three additional fields to be filled. Each endpoint returns a response indicating whether the database query was successful or not. If an error occurred, a descriptive message explaining what happened is displayed.

## ⚒️ Tools:
